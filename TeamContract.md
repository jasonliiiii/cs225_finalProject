# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
   We will meet twice per week, at 6pm on Wednesday and 12pm on Sunday. Meetings will last for 1 hour. We will hold our meetings through Wechat Conference. We will take note of the time in turn.

2. **Assistance** 
We will contact each other via Wechat, email, or phone number. We expect each other to respond in less than 12 hours.
	
3. **Respect** 
We provide each member with the opportunity to be the leader every week and we encourage each one to talk freely. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will divide up the work evenly among four of our group members, such as each person working on a different class or function. We will discuss to see if we could get the unforeseen work done on time. If not, we will try to redistribute the workload for the following weeks. We will help each other out if one of our group members is having trouble finishing his/her parts on time. 

5. **Time Commitment** 
We expected each member to commit 10 hours every week. There are no prior time commitments that need to be accounted for. When new inevitable commitments occur, we will help each other out and cover up for each other’s part. If possible, we will ask that group member to make up for his/her work afterwards.  

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We will use majority rule and vote for the better option. If he/she doesn’t accomplish the task or continues to be late for meetings, we will talk with him/her first and if such circumstances happen more than three times, we will report the situation to our mentor or TAs who are in charge. We can’t think of any other situations that we need to address ahead of time. We will all try our best to accomplish our task and try to hold each other accountable.
